Conway's Game Of Life
==========

Conway's Game of Life (C#)
For purposes of learning C#, I'm writing a basic implementation.

Works! Start position notation is 0 or 1 with -1 meaning go to next row.
Todo: Address the major limitation that the Grid has 'end of the world' edges where everythong outside of it is dead.
Todo: Allow starting position by user input.
Todo: Create GUI so user can enter starting position by clicking around.
Todo: Add subclasses for alternate rules and experiment.
